Short answer? Because it's fun! 

Really, my decision to become a software developer was a pretty quick and simple - it was fun and I was good at it. My decision to remain a software developer has since been built out for several reasons. 

**1. It's fun.** I know, I know. I already said this, but it's really the number one reason. I am a maker. I love designing and creating things. 

**2. It's project based.**  Projects have a beginning and end. Repeated tasks bore me. 

**3. I'm breaking the norm.** I have always been a girl that liked to keep up with/beat the boys. This is just another extension of that. 

**4. They pay me.** And they pay me well. With a few months training, I was out in the work force raking in the dough.  

**5. There's satisfaction in solving problems.** All day I get to use my creativity and math skills to solve complex problems. I have never felt the same amount of accomplishment in any other job.
